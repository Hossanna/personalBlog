                    Is there an amount of money that should be in my account to become an adult? Terrifying, innit? </p>

                <p>
                    When you take an early morning run in the dry season, it's very difficult to see far ahead and far behind 
                    because the fog clouds your view. You see just enough to keep running. I'd focus on the looking ahead 
                    because that's where adulthood is, rather than looking backwards which was your childhood.
                </p> 
                <h3>What does adulthood mean in one sentence?</h3> 
                <p> Taking responsibility for your life. </p>

                    so many guesses to be made, so many mistakes to learn from, tasks seem burdensome, you might hit your leg 
                    on a stone many times on that run. </p>

                    Also, the fog in front of you drives your curiosity, draws you in and exposes you with every moving step.
                    At the end of the day, what matters? Start moving in your fog, and when you do, keep jogging - or walking, one step at a time. </b>
